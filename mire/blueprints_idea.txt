- building parse CONFIG and use the parsed configuration in the program
 - the possible options should be defined in struct in header file
 - in the header file, the structure of options are defined (maybe by typedef)
- blueprint for CONFIG file:
 - required values
  - xmax ('xmax')
  - gridpoints ('mesh')
  - output file name ('fileout') (this may be fixed)
  - number of nodes ('nodes')(this may be transformed to other form .. may the range or set of number of nodes .. so generalizing)
  - Trial energy ('e') (it may be eliminated later)
  - () fixed energy scheme or finding energy scheme
  - () print options (should be refined more)
   - whether print or not the sequence of converging energy
   - format of printing numbers .. how many digits under punctuation etc.
     e.g. 8.3f
   - name of image file name.. for each plotting mode (e.g. TISE, TDSE etc.)
  - save options
   - save sequence of converging energy

- binary program hierarchy
 - finding eigenstates
  - for various potentials (even, time-inde, time-de etc.)
  - for various dimensions (1D,2D,3D ...)
  - for various systems
 - calculating propationor
 - plotting (it may not be binary)
  - plotting script for TISE and TDSE should be separated for maintanence etc.
    but, it would be good to share common tools by importing common python file

- mpi or GPU implementation is required only when the execution time is big.
- paging or dividing into blocks is required when the main memory is not enough (like GStream)
- python interface is required when multiple binary program (finding eigenstate, propagator etc.) is present


Visualization fo 2D-solution
- including both correlated and uncorellated solutions
- should be determined after practicing matplotlib 2-dimensional (3D in plotting) graph
- blueprint for data file for plotting (time-independent case) 
- blueprint for data file for plotting (time-dependent case)
